### Tutorial: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with JavaScript

#### Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code in a way that is easy to manage, reuse, and maintain. JavaScript, despite being a prototype-based language, supports OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation. This tutorial will cover these concepts in detail, providing examples to illustrate how OOP can be implemented in JavaScript.

### 1. Understanding Objects

In JavaScript, objects are collections of properties, which are key-value pairs. Objects can be created using object literals or constructor functions.

##### Example: Creating Objects with Object Literals

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
// Creating an object using an object literal
const person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 30,
    fullName: function() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
};

console.log(person.fullName()); // Output: John Doe
```

**Explanation**:
- An object `person` is created with properties `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, and a method `fullName` that returns the full name of the person.

##### Example: Creating Objects with Constructor Functions

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
// Constructor function
function Person(firstName, lastName, age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
    this.fullName = function() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    };
}

// Creating an object using the constructor function
const person1 = new Person('Jane', 'Doe', 25);
console.log(person1.fullName()); // Output: Jane Doe
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Person` constructor function is used to create a new object with the properties `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, and a method `fullName`.

### 2. Classes

ES6 introduced the `class` syntax to JavaScript, which provides a cleaner and more concise way to create objects and handle inheritance.

#### Example: Defining a Class

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
// Defining a class
class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName, age) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Method
    fullName() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
}

// Creating an instance of the class
const person1 = new Person('Alice', 'Smith', 28);
console.log(person1.fullName()); // Output: Alice Smith
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Person` class is defined with a constructor that initializes the properties `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`.
- The `fullName` method returns the full name of the person.
- An instance of the `Person` class is created using the `new` keyword.

### 3. Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This helps in code reusability and organization.

#### Example: Implementing Inheritance

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
// Defining a base class
class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName, age) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.age = age;
    }

    fullName() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
}

// Defining a subclass
class Employee extends Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName, age, jobTitle) {
        super(firstName, lastName, age);
        this.jobTitle = jobTitle;
    }

    getJobDescription() {
        return `${this.fullName()} is a ${this.jobTitle}`;
    }
}

// Creating an instance of the subclass
const employee1 = new Employee('Bob', 'Johnson', 35, 'Software Engineer');
console.log(employee1.getJobDescription()); // Output: Bob Johnson is a Software Engineer
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Person` class is defined as the base class.
- The `Employee` class is defined as a subclass of `Person` using the `extends` keyword.
- The `super` keyword is used to call the constructor of the base class.
- An instance of the `Employee` class is created, and the `getJobDescription` method returns the job description of the employee.

### 4. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (properties) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class and restricting access to some of the object's components.

#### Example: Implementing Encapsulation

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
// Defining a class with private properties and methods
class Person {
    #firstName;
    #lastName;
    #age;

    constructor(firstName, lastName, age) {
        this.#firstName = firstName;
        this.#lastName = lastName;
        this.#age = age;
    }

    getFullName() {
        return `${this.#firstName} ${this.#lastName}`;
    }

    getAge() {
        return this.#age;
    }

    setAge(age) {
        if (age > 0) {
            this.#age = age;
        }
    }
}

// Creating an instance of the class
const person1 = new Person('Charlie', 'Brown', 30);
console.log(person1.getFullName()); // Output: Charlie Brown
console.log(person1.getAge()); // Output: 30

person1.setAge(35);
console.log(person1.getAge()); // Output: 35
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Person` class is defined with private properties `#firstName`, `#lastName`, and `#age` using the `#` syntax.
- Getter methods (`getFullName` and `getAge`) provide access to private properties.
- A setter method (`setAge`) allows modification of the `#age` property with validation.
- An instance of the `Person` class is created, and the private properties are accessed and modified using the public methods.

### 5. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same name.

#### Example: Implementing Polymorphism

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
// Defining a base class
class Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log('Animal speaks');
    }
}

// Defining a subclass
class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log('Dog barks');
    }
}

// Defining another subclass
class Cat extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log('Cat meows');
    }
}

// Creating instances of the subclasses
const dog = new Dog();
const cat = new Cat();

// Demonstrating polymorphism
dog.speak(); // Output: Dog barks
cat.speak(); // Output: Cat meows
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Animal` class is defined as the base class with a `speak` method.
- The `Dog` and `Cat` classes are subclasses that override the `speak` method.
- Instances of the `Dog` and `Cat` classes demonstrate polymorphism by calling their respective `speak` methods.

### Conclusion

Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript allows for creating reusable and maintainable code by leveraging concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. By understanding and applying these principles, you can build complex and efficient applications.
