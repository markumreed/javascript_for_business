The error message you're seeing in VSCode is letting you know that Git needs your name and email to be configured before you can make commits. This information is used to label your commits with your identity. Hereâ€™s how you can resolve it:

1. **Open the Terminal in VSCode**:
   - You can open the terminal by going to `View` > `Terminal` or by pressing `` Ctrl + ` ``.

2. **Configure Your Git User Name and Email**:
   - In the terminal, run the following commands to set your user name and email:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
   ```

   Replace `"Your Name"` with your actual name and `"your-email@example.com"` with your actual email address.

3. **Verify the Configuration** (Optional):
   - You can check if the configuration was successful by running:

   ```bash
   git config --global --list
   ```

   This should display your configured `user.name` and `user.email`.

After configuring, Git should no longer prompt you for this information when making commits.
