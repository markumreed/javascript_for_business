# JavaScript Basic Syntax

#### Introduction

This tutorial will cover the basics of JavaScript syntax, including variables, data types, and operators, using business case examples. By understanding these fundamental concepts, you can start creating dynamic and interactive web applications tailored to business scenarios.

#### Variables

Variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

##### 1. `var`

- **Scope**: `var` is function-scoped, meaning it is accessible within the function it is declared in. If declared outside a function, it becomes global-scoped.
- **Redeclaration**: `var` can be re-declared and updated within its scope.

**Example**:
Imagine you need to track the total sales of a product in a month.

```javascript
var totalSales = 5000; // Initial total sales
console.log(totalSales); // Output: 5000

// Updating the total sales
totalSales = 7000;
console.log(totalSales); // Output: 7000
```

**Explanation**:
In this example, `totalSales` is a variable declared with `var`. Initially, it holds the value `5000`, representing the total sales amount at the beginning of the month. As sales continue, we update `totalSales` to `7000`, reflecting the new sales total. The `console.log` statements are used to print the value of `totalSales` before and after updating it, showing how its value changes over time.

##### 2. `let`

- **Scope**: `let` is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block (e.g., within `{}`) it is declared in.
- **Redeclaration**: `let` cannot be re-declared within the same scope but can be updated.

**Example**:
Suppose you need to calculate the monthly profit for different branches of your business.

```javascript
let branch1Profit = 2000;
let branch2Profit = 3000;
console.log(branch1Profit, branch2Profit); // Output: 2000 3000

// Updating the profit values
branch1Profit = 2500;
branch2Profit = 3500;
console.log(branch1Profit, branch2Profit); // Output: 2500 3500
```

**Explanation**:
In this example, `branch1Profit` and `branch2Profit` are variables declared with `let`. They store the profit for two different branches. Initially, `branch1Profit` is `2000` and `branch2Profit` is `3000`. As new profit data comes in, we update these values to `2500` and `3500`, respectively. The `console.log` statements display the profit values before and after the update, demonstrating how `let` allows for updating values within their scope.

##### 3. `const`

- **Scope**: `const` is block-scoped, like `let`.
- **Redeclaration and Update**: `const` cannot be re-declared or updated. It is used to declare constants whose values should not change.

**Example**:
Consider a scenario where you need to define the company name and tax rate, which do not change.

```javascript
const companyName = "Tech Corp";
const taxRate = 0.18;
console.log(companyName, taxRate); // Output: Tech Corp 0.18

// Attempting to update const variables will result in an error
// companyName = "New Tech Corp"; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
```

**Explanation**:
In this example, `companyName` and `taxRate` are declared with `const` because these values are constant and should not change throughout the program. `companyName` is set to "Tech Corp", and `taxRate` is set to `0.18` (18%). Attempting to reassign a value to a `const` variable will result in an error, which ensures that these constants remain unchanged, providing stability and predictability in the code.

#### Data Types

JavaScript supports various data types, which help in managing different kinds of data effectively.

##### 1. Primitive Data Types

- **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
- **String**: Represents a sequence of characters.
- **Boolean**: Represents logical values, `true` or `false`.
- **Undefined**: Indicates a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
- **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- **Symbol**: Represents a unique and immutable identifier.

**Example**:
Suppose you need to manage data about a product in an inventory system.

```javascript
let productID = 101; // Number
let productName = "Laptop"; // String
let inStock = true; // Boolean
let discount; // Undefined
let discontinuedProduct = null; // Null
let uniqueID = Symbol('id'); // Symbol

console.log(productID, productName, inStock, discount, discontinuedProduct, uniqueID);
// Output: 101 Laptop true undefined null Symbol(id)
```

**Explanation**:
In this example, various data types are used to represent different attributes of a product in an inventory system. `productID` is a number representing the product's identifier, `productName` is a string containing the product's name, and `inStock` is a boolean indicating whether the product is available. `discount` is undefined, showing it has been declared but not assigned a value. `discontinuedProduct` is set to `null`, indicating the product is intentionally absent. Finally, `uniqueID` is a symbol providing a unique identifier for the product.

##### 2. Complex Data Types

- **Object**: Used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
- **Array**: Used to store multiple values in a single variable.

**Example**:
Imagine you need to store detailed information about an employee and a list of products in an order.

```javascript
// Object for employee details
let employee = {
    name: "Jane Smith",
    position: "Manager",
    department: "Sales",
    salary: 75000
};

// Array for list of products in an order
let order = ["Laptop", "Mouse", "Keyboard"];

console.log(employee); // Output: { name: 'Jane Smith', position: 'Manager', department: 'Sales', salary: 75000 }
console.log(order); // Output: [ 'Laptop', 'Mouse', 'Keyboard' ]

// Accessing object properties
console.log(employee.name); // Output: Jane Smith

// Accessing array elements
console.log(order[0]); // Output: Laptop
```

**Explanation**:
In this example, the `employee` object stores detailed information about an employee, including their name, position, department, and salary. The `order` array contains a list of products in an order. Using `console.log`, we print the entire `employee` object and `order` array. Additionally, we access individual properties of the `employee` object and elements of the `order` array using dot notation and bracket notation, respectively. This demonstrates how objects and arrays can be used to manage complex data structures in a business context.

#### Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values, essential for manipulating data and making decisions.

##### 1. Arithmetic Operators

Perform mathematical calculations.

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulus (Remainder): `%`

**Example**:
Suppose you need to calculate the total revenue from two different products.

```javascript
let product1Revenue = 5000;
let product2Revenue = 3000;
let totalRevenue = product1Revenue + product2Revenue;

console.log("Total Revenue:", totalRevenue); // Output: Total Revenue: 8000
```

**Explanation**:
In this example, arithmetic operators are used to calculate the total revenue from two products. `product1Revenue` and `product2Revenue` represent the revenue generated by two different products. By adding these values using the `+` operator, we calculate the `totalRevenue`. The `console.log` statement prints the total revenue, showing how arithmetic operations can be used to perform financial calculations in a business setting.

##### 2. Assignment Operators

Assign values to variables.

- Assignment: `=`
- Addition Assignment: `+=`
- Subtraction Assignment: `-=`
- Multiplication Assignment: `*=`
- Division Assignment: `/=`

**Example**:
Imagine you need to update the monthly profit of a branch.

```javascript
let monthlyProfit = 2000;
console.log("Initial Profit:", monthlyProfit); // Output: Initial Profit: 2000

// Updating the profit values
monthlyProfit += 500; // monthlyProfit = monthlyProfit + 500
console.log("Updated Profit:", monthlyProfit); // Output: Updated Profit: 2500
```

**Explanation**:
In this example, the addition assignment operator (`+=`) is used to update the monthly profit value. `monthlyProfit` is initially set to `2000`. By using `monthlyProfit += 500`, we increase the profit by `500`, resulting in a new value of `2500`. The `console.log` statements display the profit before and after the update, illustrating how assignment operators can be used to efficiently update variable values in financial calculations.

##### 3. Comparison Operators

Compare two values and return a boolean.

- Equal to: `==`
- Strict equal to: `===`
- Not equal to: `!=`
- Strict not equal to: `!==`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`

**Example**:


Suppose you need to compare the sales figures of two products.

```javascript
let product1Sales = 10000;
let product2Sales = 8000;

console.log(product1Sales > product2Sales); // Output: true
console.log(product1Sales === product2Sales); // Output: false
```

**Explanation**:
In this example, comparison operators are used to compare the sales figures of two products. `product1Sales` and `product2Sales` represent the sales figures for two different products. Using the `>` operator, we check if `product1Sales` is greater than `product2Sales`, which returns `true`. Using the `===` operator, we check if `product1Sales` is strictly equal to `product2Sales`, which returns `false`. The `console.log` statements display the results of these comparisons, demonstrating how comparison operators can be used to make decisions based on sales data.

##### 4. Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions.

- AND: `&&`
- OR: `||`
- NOT: `!`

**Example**:
Consider a scenario where you need to check if a product is in stock and if it is on sale.

```javascript
let inStock = true;
let onSale = false;

console.log(inStock && onSale); // Output: false (both conditions need to be true)
console.log(inStock || onSale); // Output: true (at least one condition needs to be true)
console.log(!inStock); // Output: false (negates the boolean value)
```

**Explanation**:
In this example, logical operators are used to combine conditions related to a product's availability and sale status. `inStock` and `onSale` are boolean variables indicating whether a product is in stock and on sale, respectively. Using the `&&` operator, we check if both conditions are true, which returns `false` because `onSale` is `false`. Using the `||` operator, we check if at least one condition is true, which returns `true` because `inStock` is `true`. Using the `!` operator, we negate the value of `inStock`, which returns `false`. The `console.log` statements display the results of these logical operations, illustrating how logical operators can be used to evaluate multiple conditions in business scenarios.
