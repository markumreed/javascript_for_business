# Deep Dive JavaScript Classes with Business Examples

JavaScript classes provide an organized and structured way to implement object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in your code. They allow you to create reusable objects, group related functionality, and implement inheritance for more complex use cases. In business applications, classes can be utilized to model real-world entities such as employees, products, transactions, etc., making the code more maintainable and scalable. This tutorial dives deep into JavaScript classes with detailed explanations and business-related examples.

## 1. Introduction to JavaScript Classes

In JavaScript, classes are templates for creating objects. They encapsulate data and functionality related to the objects and allow for easy instantiation of multiple similar objects. JavaScript classes make it easier to manage large codebases by allowing for reusable, organized, and modular code.

### Why Use Classes in Business Applications?

In business scenarios, classes help model various entities such as employees, products, orders, etc. By defining classes, you can:

- Encapsulate logic and data related to specific entities (e.g., employee, product).
- Ensure code reusability and maintainability.
- Implement inheritance to extend and reuse functionalities for similar entities.

## 2. Defining Classes

A class in JavaScript is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name. The class body contains methods and a constructor method that initializes the object.

### Syntax

```javascript
class ClassName {
  constructor() {
    // Initialization code
  }
}
```

### Example

```javascript
class Employee {
  constructor(name, position) {
    this.name = name;
    this.position = position;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Employee` class is defined with a constructor that takes two parameters: `name` and `position`.

---

## 3. Class Constructor

The **constructor** method is a special method in a class that is called when a new object is instantiated. The constructor is used to initialize object properties when an instance is created.

### Example

```javascript
class Employee {
  constructor(name, position, salary) {
    this.name = name;
    this.position = position;
    this.salary = salary;
  }
}
```

### Business Example: Employee Initialization

```javascript
class Employee {
  constructor(name, position, salary) {
    this.name = name;
    this.position = position;
    this.salary = salary;
  }
}

const employee1 = new Employee("John Doe", "Manager", 50000);
console.log(employee1.name);    // Output: John Doe
console.log(employee1.position); // Output: Manager
console.log(employee1.salary);   // Output: 50000
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Employee` class has a constructor that initializes the `name`, `position`, and `salary` properties.
- When a new employee object is created using `new Employee()`, the properties are initialized with the values provided.

---

## 4. Adding Methods

Methods are functions that belong to a class. They can be used to perform operations on the data held by the object.

### Example

```javascript
class Employee {
  constructor(name, position, salary) {
    this.name = name;
    this.position = position;
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  displayDetails() {
    console.log(`${this.name} works as a ${this.position} earning $${this.salary}`);
  }
}
```

### Business Example: Employee Detail Method

```javascript
class Employee {
  constructor(name, position, salary) {
    this.name = name;
    this.position = position;
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  displayDetails() {
    console.log(`${this.name} works as a ${this.position} earning $${this.salary} per year.`);
  }
}

const employee1 = new Employee("Jane Smith", "Developer", 60000);
employee1.displayDetails(); // Output: Jane Smith works as a Developer earning $60000 per year.
```

**Explanation:**

- The `displayDetails` method outputs the employee's details in a formatted string.
- This method is accessible from instances of the `Employee` class.

---

## 5. Creating Instances

You can create multiple instances of a class, and each instance can have different data. To create an instance, use the `new` keyword followed by the class name and the constructor parameters.

### Example

```javascript
const employee1 = new Employee("Alice", "Sales Manager", 70000);
const employee2 = new Employee("Bob", "Accountant", 55000);

employee1.displayDetails();
employee2.displayDetails();
```

**Output:**

```
Alice works as a Sales Manager earning $70000 per year.
Bob works as an Accountant earning $55000 per year.
```

**Explanation:**

- `employee1` and `employee2` are two instances of the `Employee` class, each with different properties.

---

## 6. Class Inheritance

Inheritance allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class. This promotes code reuse and helps maintain a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) codebase.

### Syntax

```javascript
class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
  constructor() {
    super(); // Calls the parent class's constructor
  }
}
```

### Example

```javascript
class Employee {
  constructor(name, salary) {
    this.name = name;
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  work() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is working.`);
  }
}

class Manager extends Employee {
  constructor(name, salary, department) {
    super(name, salary); // Call the parent constructor
    this.department = department;
  }

  manage() {
    console.log(`${this.name} manages the ${this.department} department.`);
  }
}

const manager = new Manager("Alice", 90000, "HR");
manager.work();  // Output: Alice is working.
manager.manage(); // Output: Alice manages the HR department.
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Manager` class inherits from `Employee`, meaning it has access to both the `name` and `salary` properties as well as the `work` method.
- `super(name, salary)` calls the parent class's constructor, passing along parameters needed to initialize the inherited properties.

---

## 7. Getters and Setters

Getters and setters allow controlled access to object properties. A **getter** retrieves a property, while a **setter** allows setting a property's value with custom logic.

### Example

```javascript
class Employee {
  constructor(name, salary) {
    this.name = name;
    this._salary = salary;
  }

  get salary() {
    return `$${this._salary} per year`;
  }

  set salary(newSalary) {
    if (newSalary > 0) {
      this._salary = newSalary;
    } else {
      console.log("Salary must be a positive value.");
    }
  }
}

const employee = new Employee("Bob", 50000);
console.log(employee.salary);  // Output: $50000 per year

employee.salary = 60000;
console.log(employee.salary);  // Output: $60000 per year

employee.salary = -5000;       // Output: Salary must be a positive value.
```

**Explanation:**

- The `salary` getter returns a formatted string for the salary.
- The `salary` setter ensures that the salary is only updated if the new value is positive.

---

## 8. Static Methods

Static methods are defined on the class itself rather than on instances. These methods are often used for utility functions related to the class.

### Example

```javascript
class Company {
  static calculateBonus(salary) {
    return salary * 0.1;
  }
}

const bonus = Company.calculateBonus(70000);
console.log(`Bonus: $${bonus}`); // Output: Bonus: $7000
```

**Explanation:**

- `calculateBonus` is a static method, meaning it can be called directly on the class without creating an instance.
- It calculates 10% of the salary as a bonus.

---

## 9. Private Fields and Methods

In JavaScript, private fields and methods are defined using the `#` symbol. They can only be accessed within the class and not from outside.

### Example

```javascript
class BankAccount {
  #balance = 0; // Private field

  constructor(accountHolder) {
    this.accountHolder = accountHolder;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.#balance += amount;
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.#balance;
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount("John Doe");
account.deposit(1000);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // Output: 1000
// console.log(account.#balance);  // Error: Private field cannot be accessed
```

**Explanation:**

- The `#balance` field is private and can only be accessed within the class. Any attempt to access it from outside will result in an error.

## 10. Business Example 1: Employee Management System

Letâ€™s build a small Employee Management System using classes.

```javascript
class Employee {
  constructor(name, position, salary) {
    this.name = name;
    this.position = position;
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  getAnnualSalary() {
    return this.salary * 12;
  }

  displayDetails() {
    console.log(`${

this.name}, ${this.position}, earns $${this.salary} per month.`);
  }
}

class Manager extends Employee {
  constructor(name, department, salary) {
    super(name, "Manager", salary);
    this.department = department;
  }

  assignTask(task) {
    console.log(`${this.name} is assigning the task: ${task}`);
  }
}

const manager = new Manager("Alice", "HR", 8000);
manager.displayDetails(); // Output: Alice, Manager, earns $8000 per month.
manager.assignTask("Recruit new employees"); // Output: Alice is assigning the task: Recruit new employees.
console.log(`Annual Salary: $${manager.getAnnualSalary()}`); // Output: Annual Salary: $96000
```

## 11. Business Example 2: Product Inventory Management

Now, let's use classes to manage a product inventory system.

```javascript
class Product {
  constructor(name, price, stock) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
    this.stock = stock;
  }

  sell(quantity) {
    if (this.stock >= quantity) {
      this.stock -= quantity;
      console.log(`${quantity} ${this.name}(s) sold. Stock left: ${this.stock}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Not enough stock for ${this.name}. Only ${this.stock} left.`);
    }
  }

  restock(quantity) {
    this.stock += quantity;
    console.log(`${this.name} restocked. New stock: ${this.stock}`);
  }
}

const laptop = new Product("Laptop", 1200, 50);
laptop.sell(10);   // Output: 10 Laptop(s) sold. Stock left: 40
laptop.restock(20); // Output: Laptop restocked. New stock: 60
```
