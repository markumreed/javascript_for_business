## 1. Introduction to Control Structures

### What are Control Structures?

Control structures are programming constructs that dictate the order in which statements are executed in a program. They allow developers to dictate the flow of logic based on certain conditions or the repetition of tasks. The primary types of control structures in JavaScript include:

- **Conditional Statements**: Execute code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false.
- **Loops**: Repeat code blocks multiple times.
- **Control Flow Interruptions**: Alter the flow of execution within loops or functions.

### Importance of Control Structures in Business Applications

In business applications, control structures are essential for:

- **Decision Making**: Automating responses based on user inputs or data conditions.
- **Data Processing**: Iterating over large datasets to perform operations like calculations, validations, or transformations.
- **Optimizing Performance**: Efficiently managing tasks to enhance the application's responsiveness and reliability.

## 2. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow your program to execute certain blocks of code based on whether specified conditions are met.

### `if` Statement

The `if` statement executes a block of code if a specified condition evaluates to `true`.

#### Syntax

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if condition is true
}
```

#### Example

```javascript
let totalSales = 1500;

if (totalSales > 1000) {
  console.log("You have achieved a high sales target!");
}
```

#### Output

```
You have achieved a high sales target!
```

### `else if` and `else` Statements

The `else if` and `else` statements provide additional conditions and a default block if none of the previous conditions are met.

#### Syntax

```javascript
if (condition1) {
  // Code if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Code if condition2 is true
} else {
  // Code if none of the above conditions are true
}
```

#### Example

```javascript
let customerType = "premium";

if (customerType === "new") {
  console.log("Offer a welcome discount.");
} else if (customerType === "premium") {
  console.log("Provide premium support.");
} else {
  console.log("Standard service package.");
}
```

#### Output

```
Provide premium support.
```

### `switch` Statement

The `switch` statement evaluates an expression and executes code blocks based on matching case values.

#### Syntax

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to execute for value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to execute for value2
    break;
  default:
    // Code to execute if no cases match
}
```

#### Example

```javascript
let paymentMethod = "Credit Card";

switch (paymentMethod) {
  case "Credit Card":
    console.log("Processing credit card payment.");
    break;
  case "PayPal":
    console.log("Processing PayPal payment.");
    break;
  case "Bank Transfer":
    console.log("Processing bank transfer.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Unsupported payment method.");
}
```

#### Output

```
Processing credit card payment.
```

### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator provides a shorthand way of writing `if...else` statements.

#### Syntax

```javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

#### Example

```javascript
let stock = 20;
let message = stock > 0 ? "In Stock" : "Out of Stock";
console.log(message);
```

#### Output

```
In Stock
```

### Business Examples

#### Business Example 1: Determining Shipping Costs

Calculate shipping costs based on the total order amount.

```javascript
function calculateShipping(totalAmount) {
  if (totalAmount > 500) {
    return "Free Shipping";
  } else if (totalAmount > 200) {
    return "$10 Shipping Fee";
  } else {
    return "$20 Shipping Fee";
  }
}

let orderAmount = 250;
let shippingCost = calculateShipping(orderAmount);
console.log(`Shipping Cost: ${shippingCost}`);
```

**Output:**

```
Shipping Cost: $10 Shipping Fee
```

**Explanation:**

- Orders above $500 receive free shipping.
- Orders between $201 and $500 are charged a $10 fee.
- Orders $200 or below incur a $20 shipping fee.

#### Business Example 2: Assigning Customer Priority Levels

Assign priority levels to customers based on their purchase history.

```javascript
function getCustomerPriority(totalPurchases) {
  if (totalPurchases > 10000) {
    return "Platinum";
  } else if (totalPurchases > 5000) {
    return "Gold";
  } else if (totalPurchases > 1000) {
    return "Silver";
  } else {
    return "Bronze";
  }
}

let customerPurchases = 7500;
let priorityLevel = getCustomerPriority(customerPurchases);
console.log(`Customer Priority Level: ${priorityLevel}`);
```

**Output:**

```
Customer Priority Level: Gold
```

**Explanation:**

- **Platinum**: Customers with purchases over $10,000.
- **Gold**: Customers with purchases between $5,001 and $10,000.
- **Silver**: Customers with purchases between $1,001 and $5,000.
- **Bronze**: Customers with purchases up to $1,000.

## 3. Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times, which is particularly useful for processing collections of data.

### `for` Loop

The `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

#### Syntax

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // Code to execute in each iteration
}
```

#### Example

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(`Order Number: ${i}`);
}
```

#### Output

```
Order Number: 1
Order Number: 2
Order Number: 3
Order Number: 4
Order Number: 5
```

### `while` Loop

The `while` loop continues to execute as long as the specified condition remains `true`.

#### Syntax

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // Code to execute
}
```

#### Example

```javascript
let count = 1;

while (count <= 3) {
  console.log(`Processing item ${count}`);
  count++;
}
```

#### Output

```
Processing item 1
Processing item 2
Processing item 3
```

### `do...while` Loop

The `do...while` loop executes the code block once before checking the condition.

#### Syntax

```javascript
do {
  // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```

#### Example

```javascript
let attempt = 1;

do {
  console.log(`Login attempt ${attempt}`);
  attempt++;
} while (attempt <= 2);
```

#### Output

```
Login attempt 1
Login attempt 2
```

### `for...in` Loop

The `for...in` loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.

#### Syntax

```javascript
for (let key in object) {
  // Code to execute
}
```

#### Example

```javascript
let product = {
  name: "Laptop",
  price: 1200,
  stock: 30
};

for (let property in product) {
  console.log(`${property}: ${product[property]}`);
}
```

#### Output

```
name: Laptop
price: 1200
stock: 30
```

### `for...of` Loop

The `for...of

` loop iterates over iterable objects like arrays, strings, etc.

#### Syntax

```javascript
for (let element of iterable) {
  // Code to execute
}
```

#### Example

```javascript
let customers = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

for (let customer of customers) {
  console.log(`Welcome, ${customer}!`);
}
```

#### Output

```
Welcome, Alice!
Welcome, Bob!
Welcome, Charlie!
```

### `forEach` Method

The `forEach` method executes a provided function once for each array element.

#### Syntax

```javascript
array.forEach(function(element, index, array) {
  // Code to execute
});
```

#### Example

```javascript
let sales = [500, 750, 1200];

sales.forEach((sale, index) => {
  console.log(`Sale ${index + 1}: $${sale}`);
});
```

#### Output

```
Sale 1: $500
Sale 2: $750
Sale 3: $1200
```

### Business Examples

#### Business Example 1: Processing Orders

Iterate through a list of orders to calculate the total revenue.

```javascript
let orders = [
  { id: 1, amount: 250 },
  { id: 2, amount: 450 },
  { id: 3, amount: 300 }
];

let totalRevenue = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < orders.length; i++) {
  totalRevenue += orders[i].amount;
}

console.log(`Total Revenue: $${totalRevenue}`);
```

**Output:**

```
Total Revenue: $1000
```

**Explanation:**

- The `for` loop iterates over each order in the `orders` array, summing up the `amount` to calculate total revenue.

#### Business Example 2: Generating Reports

Use a `forEach` loop to generate a sales report.

```javascript
let salesData = [
  { product: "Laptop", unitsSold: 50 },
  { product: "Smartphone", unitsSold: 150 },
  { product: "Tablet", unitsSold: 80 }
];

console.log("Sales Report:");
salesData.forEach((item) => {
  console.log(`${item.product}: ${item.unitsSold} units sold`);
});
```

**Output:**

```
Sales Report:
Laptop: 50 units sold
Smartphone: 150 units sold
Tablet: 80 units sold
```

**Explanation:**

- The `forEach` method iterates over each item in `salesData`, printing out the product name and units sold.

---

## 4. Control Flow Interruptions

Control flow interruptions allow you to alter the normal flow of execution within loops or functions.

### `break` Statement

The `break` statement terminates the current loop or switch statement.

#### Syntax

```javascript
break;
```

#### Example

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // Exit the loop when i is 5
  }
  console.log(`Number: ${i}`);
}
```

#### Output

```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
```

### `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

#### Syntax

```javascript
continue;
```

#### Example

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    continue; // Skip when i is 3
  }
  console.log(`Iteration: ${i}`);
}
```

#### Output

```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
```

### `return` Statement in Functions

The `return` statement exits a function and optionally returns a value.

#### Syntax

```javascript
return value;
```

#### Example

```javascript
function findFirstLargeSale(sales) {
  for (let sale of sales) {
    if (sale > 1000) {
      return sale; // Exit the function when a sale > 1000 is found
    }
  }
  return null; // If no sale > 1000 is found
}

let salesAmounts = [500, 750, 1200, 300];
let largeSale = findFirstLargeSale(salesAmounts);
console.log(`First Large Sale: ${largeSale}`);
```

#### Output

```
First Large Sale: 1200
```

### Business Examples

#### Business Example 1: Validating User Input

Terminate the input process if invalid data is detected.

```javascript
function validateOrder(order) {
  for (let item of order.items) {
    if (item.quantity <= 0) {
      console.log(`Invalid quantity for product: ${item.product}`);
      return false; // Exit the function if invalid
    }
  }
  return true; // All items are valid
}

let customerOrder = {
  customer: "John Doe",
  items: [
    { product: "Laptop", quantity: 2 },
    { product: "Mouse", quantity: 0 } // Invalid quantity
  ]
};

let isValid = validateOrder(customerOrder);
console.log(`Order Valid: ${isValid}`);
```

**Output:**

```
Invalid quantity for product: Mouse
Order Valid: false
```

**Explanation:**

- The `validateOrder` function checks each item's quantity.
- If an invalid quantity is found (e.g., 0 or negative), it logs an error message and exits the function using `return`.

#### Business Example 2: Skipping Incomplete Data Entries

Use `continue` to skip processing incomplete or irrelevant data.

```javascript
let employeeRecords = [
  { name: "Alice", sales: 3000 },
  { name: "Bob", sales: null }, // Incomplete data
  { name: "Charlie", sales: 5000 }
];

employeeRecords.forEach((employee) => {
  if (employee.sales === null) {
    console.log(`Skipping ${employee.name} due to incomplete sales data.`);
    return; // Skip this iteration
  }
  console.log(`${employee.name} has sales of $${employee.sales}`);
});
```

#### Output:

```
Alice has sales of $3000
Skipping Bob due to incomplete sales data.
Charlie has sales of $5000
```

**Explanation:**

- The `forEach` loop processes each employee.
- If an employee's sales data is `null`, it logs a message and skips further processing for that employee using `return`.

## 5. Logical Operators and Short-Circuit Evaluation

Logical operators allow you to combine multiple conditions, while short-circuit evaluation optimizes the evaluation process.

### Logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`)

- **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Returns `true` if both operands are `true`.
- **Logical OR (`||`)**: Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`.

#### Examples

```javascript
let isMember = true;
let hasCoupon = false;

// Logical AND
if (isMember && hasCoupon) {
  console.log("Apply discount.");
} else {
  console.log("No discount available.");
}

// Logical OR
if (isMember || hasCoupon) {
  console.log("Eligible for discount.");
} else {
  console.log("No discount available.");
}
```

#### Output

```
No discount available.
Eligible for discount.
```

### Short-Circuit Evaluation

JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right and stops as soon as the outcome is determined.

#### Example

```javascript
function logMessage(message) {
  console.log(message);
  return true;
}

let condition = false;

// Short-circuit with AND
condition && logMessage("This will not be logged.");

// Short-circuit with OR
condition || logMessage("This will be logged.");
```

#### Output

```
This will be logged.
```

**Explanation:**

- The `&&` operator stops evaluating when the first operand (`condition`) is `false`, so `logMessage` is not called.
- The `||` operator calls `logMessage` because the first operand (`condition`) is `false`.

### Business Examples

#### Business Example 1: Conditional Feature Activation

Activate features based on user role and subscription status.

```javascript
let userRole = "admin";
let isSubscribed = true;

if (userRole === "admin" && isSubscribed) {
  console.log("Access granted to advanced analytics dashboard.");
} else {
  console.log("Access denied.");
}
```

#### Output:

```
Access granted to advanced analytics dashboard.
```

**Explanation:**

- Both conditions (`userRole === "admin"` and `isSubscribed`) must be `true` to grant access.

#### Business Example 2: Efficient Data Validation

Use short-circuit evaluation to validate data before processing.

```javascript
function processOrder(order) {
  // Check if order and customer information exist
  order && order.customer && order.items && process(order);
}

function process(order) {
  console.log(`Processing order for ${order.customer.name}`);
}

let validOrder = {
  customer: { name: "Alice" },
  items: ["Laptop", "Mouse"]
};

let invalidOrder = null;

processOrder(validOrder);   // Outputs: Processing order for Alice
processOrder(invalidOrder); // No output, as the condition fails
```

**Explanation:**

- The `processOrder` function only calls `process(order)` if all conditions are `true`.
- If `order` is `null`, the function short-circuits and does not attempt to process the order, preventing errors.

## 6. Nested Control Structures

Nesting control structures involves placing one control structure inside another, allowing for more complex decision-making and iteration.

### Concept of Nesting

Nesting can occur with any combination of control structures, such as an `if` statement inside a `for` loop or a `for` loop inside an `if` statement.

### Best Practices for Nested Structures

- **Limit Depth**: Avoid excessive nesting to maintain code readability and maintainability.
- **Use Functions**: Break down complex nested structures into smaller functions.
- **Consistent Indentation**: Properly indent nested code blocks for clarity.

### Business Examples

#### Business Example 1: Multi-Level Discount Calculations

Apply different discount tiers based on customer type and total purchase amount.

```javascript
function calculateDiscount(customerType, totalAmount) {
  let discount = 0;

  if (customerType === "VIP") {
    if (totalAmount > 1000) {
      discount = 20; // 20% discount for VIPs over $1000
    } else {
      discount = 15; // 15% discount for VIPs up to $1000
    }
  } else if (customerType === "Regular") {
    if (totalAmount > 1000) {
      discount = 10; // 10% discount for Regular customers over $1000
    } else {
      discount = 5; // 5% discount for Regular customers up to $1000
    }
  } else {
    discount = 0; // No discount for others
  }

  return discount;
}

let discount1 = calculateDiscount("VIP", 1500);
let discount2 = calculateDiscount("Regular", 800);
let discount3 = calculateDiscount("Guest", 500);

console.log(`VIP Discount: ${discount1}%`);       // Output: VIP Discount: 20%
console.log(`Regular Discount: ${discount2}%`);  // Output: Regular Discount: 5%
console.log(`Guest Discount: ${discount3}%`);    // Output: Guest Discount: 0%
```

**Explanation:**

- The function `calculateDiscount` uses nested `if` statements to determine the appropriate discount based on customer type and purchase amount.

#### Business Example 2: Complex Inventory Management

Check inventory levels and reorder products if stock is below a threshold, considering supplier reliability.

```javascript
function manageInventory(product) {
  if (product.stock < product.minStock) {
    if (product.supplierReliability === "high") {
      console.log(`Reordering ${product.name} from reliable supplier.`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Reordering ${product.name} from alternate supplier.`);
    }
  } else {
    console.log(`${product.name} stock is sufficient.`);
  }
}

let products = [
  { name: "Laptop", stock: 5, minStock: 10, supplierReliability: "high" },
  { name: "Mouse", stock: 15, minStock: 10, supplierReliability: "low" },
  { name: "Keyboard", stock: 8, minStock: 10, supplierReliability: "medium" }
];

products.forEach(product => manageInventory(product));
```

#### Output:

```
Reordering Laptop from reliable supplier.
Mouse stock is sufficient.
Keyboard stock is sufficient.
```

**Explanation:**

- The `manageInventory` function uses nested `if` statements to decide whether to reorder products based on stock levels and supplier reliability.
- In this example, "Mouse" has sufficient stock, while "Laptop" is reordered from the reliable supplier due to low stock.
