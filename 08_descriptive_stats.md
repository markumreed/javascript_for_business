### Tutorial: Descriptive Statistics in JavaScript: Measures of Central Tendency and Variability

#### Introduction

Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. This tutorial will cover the measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation) using JavaScript. We will use the `simple-statistics` library to perform these calculations.

### Setting Up Simple-statistics

To use Simple-statistics, you can include it in your HTML file or install it via npm if you're using Node.js.

##### Example: Including Simple-statistics in an HTML File

**HTML**:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Descriptive Statistics with JavaScript</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-statistics@7.4.0/dist/simple-statistics.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Descriptive Statistics with JavaScript</h1>
    <div id="output"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency include the mean, median, and mode. These measures describe the center of a dataset.

#### Mean

The mean is the average of a dataset. It is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
<script>
    // Sample data
    const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

    // Calculating mean
    const mean = ss.mean(data);
    console.log('Mean:', mean);
</script>
```

**Explanation**:
- The `ss.mean` function from the `simple-statistics` library calculates the mean of the dataset.

#### Median

The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered. If the number of values is even, it is the average of the two middle numbers.

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
<script>
    // Sample data
    const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

    // Calculating median
    const median = ss.median(data);
    console.log('Median:', median);
</script>
```

**Explanation**:
- The `ss.median` function from the `simple-statistics` library calculates the median of the dataset.

#### Mode

The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. If all values are unique, the mode may not be meaningful.

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
<script>
    // Sample data
    const data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7];

    // Calculating mode
    const mode = ss.mode(data);
    console.log('Mode:', mode);
</script>
```

**Explanation**:
- The `ss.mode` function from the `simple-statistics` library calculates the mode of the dataset.

### Measures of Variability

Measures of variability include the range, variance, and standard deviation. These measures describe the spread of a dataset.

#### Range

The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
<script>
    // Sample data
    const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

    // Calculating range
    const range = ss.max(data) - ss.min(data);
    console.log('Range:', range);
</script>
```

**Explanation**:
- The range is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value of the dataset.

#### Variance

Variance measures the spread of the data points. It is the average of the squared differences from the mean.

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
<script>
    // Sample data
    const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

    // Calculating variance
    const variance = ss.variance(data);
    console.log('Variance:', variance);
</script>
```

**Explanation**:
- The `ss.variance` function from the `simple-statistics` library calculates the variance of the dataset.

#### Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, providing a measure of the average distance of the data points from the mean.

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
<script>
    // Sample data
    const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

    // Calculating standard deviation
    const standardDeviation = ss.standardDeviation(data);
    console.log('Standard Deviation:', standardDeviation);
</script>
```

**Explanation**:
- The `ss.standardDeviation` function from the `simple-statistics` library calculates the standard deviation of the dataset.

### Example: Descriptive Statistics on Real-World Data

Let's apply these measures to a real-world dataset. For this example, we will use a dataset of test scores.

**JavaScript**:
```javascript
<script>
    // Sample data: Test scores
    const testScores = [85, 87, 90, 92, 88, 76, 95, 89, 84, 91];

    // Calculating mean
    const mean = ss.mean(testScores);
    console.log('Mean:', mean);

    // Calculating median
    const median = ss.median(testScores);
    console.log('Median:', median);

    // Calculating mode
    const mode = ss.mode(testScores);
    console.log('Mode:', mode);

    // Calculating range
    const range = ss.max(testScores) - ss.min(testScores);
    console.log('Range:', range);

    // Calculating variance
    const variance = ss.variance(testScores);
    console.log('Variance:', variance);

    // Calculating standard deviation
    const standardDeviation = ss.standardDeviation(testScores);
    console.log('Standard Deviation:', standardDeviation);
</script>
```

**Explanation**:
- The dataset `testScores` contains test scores of students.
- The mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation of the test scores are calculated using the `simple-statistics` library.

### Conclusion

Descriptive statistics provide a way to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) describe the center of the data, while measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation) describe the spread of the data. Using JavaScript and the `simple-statistics` library, you can easily calculate these measures to gain insights into your data.
